# Indent Horizon

A community hosted Space MMORPG

## Getting a shard key:

In order register your shard on the official shard network, you need to get a key. Keys can be obtained from https://indenthorizon.com/shards/register

## About Indent Horizon Shards

Each registered shard is accessible through the global shard network cache, which can be listed in json format with an HTTP GET request to https://indenthorizon.com/shards/list

## Trust

Shards ran by the community obviously are extended a great deal of trust. Ideally, a complaint and report system will be built into the game at a later date, along with community standards, to keep shards one the official network compliant
